# Abstract
<div align="justify">The Bipedal Robot is a humanoid robot modeled to mimic the walking of a human, the Robot is designed to have 6 degrees of freedom in total, implying 3 degrees of freedom in each leg, 2 of which are used for moving the leg in forward or backward direction using Servo motors at each joint(hip and knee), while the other degree of freedom is used for balancing the robot using another servo motor when standing on one leg, the mechanical model is designed to avoid extra weight so that the balance of the robot is more stable. The robot is actuated by using the microcontroller Arduino.</div>

## Motivation
<div align="justify">Bipedal robots are able to move in areas that are normally inaccessible to wheeled robots, such as stairs and areas littered with obstacles that make wheeled locomotion impossible, also they can be an asset which can work in hazardous conditions.</div>

## Mechanical Aspect

1. <div align="justify">Robot’s size selection - 
   Robot size plays a major role. Based on the cost of project, materials required for fabrication and the no. of actuators can be determined. In this project the size of the robot is preferred so a height of 300mm is decided which includes mountings of the control circuits, but the actual size of the robot is 230mm without controlling circuits.</div>

2. <div align="justify">Degrees of Freedom (D.O.F) - 
   Human leg has got 6 degrees of freedom (Hip – 3 D.O.F , Knee – 1 D.O.F , Ankle – 2 D.O.F) , but implementing all the 6 D.O.F is difficult due to increase in cost of project and controlling of the actuators which become complex, so in this project reduced degrees of freedom is aimed so 3 D.O.F(Ankle , Knee and Hip) per leg has been finalized.</div> 
   																								
3. <div align="justify">Foot Pad Design - 
   The stability of the robot is determined by the foot pad. Generally, there is concept that oversized and heavy foot pad will have more stability due to more contact area. But there is a disadvantage in using the oversized and heavy foot pad, because the torque requirement of the motor is more and lifting the leg against the gravity becomes difficult. By considering this disadvantage an optimal sized foot pad was used. Dimensions of the foot pad are 75x70mm.</div>
   																																		
## Electronic Aspect

1. <div align="justify">Power Source - 
   11.1 Volts 2200mAh Li-Po battery is used as the power source for powering the Arduino as well as the Servo motors, for the Servo motors IC814 chips are used to convert the battery voltage to the rating value of the Servo motors as well as ensuring optimum current flow in all the motors.</div>
   																			
2. <div align="justify">Actuation - 
   All the movement is actuated using Metal gear Servo motors, one motor is used for a single degree of freedom, so six Servo motors in all are needed for the 6 degree of freedoms in the robot.</div>
   																																	
3. <div align="justify">Motor Selection - 
   The choice of motors was based on the idea of reducing weight as well as creating a less complex feedback mechanism, hence the choice of using high torque metal gear position control DC Servo motors was appropriate under the given constraints.</div>
   																																	
4. <div align="justify">Microcontroller - 
   Arduino UNO R3 is used as the microcontroller which can operate six Servo motors at a time, enabling various types of motion such as forward, backward etc.</div>

## Cost Structure 

| Materials  | Cost(INR) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 6 DC Servo Motors | 3000 |
| Arduino UNO R3  |400 |
|  11.1 Li-Po Battery  | 1800 |
| Miscellaneous | 300 |
| Total | 5500 |

## Applications
1. <div align="justify">The movement of the robot can be controlled by using a remote controller.</div>
2. <div align="justify">The bipedal robot can assist humans to carry out the tasks or activities in hazardous environment which could eliminate human's risk of injury or life casualty.</div>
3. <div align="justify">They can be used for household work for the disabled or someone  suffering from any disease.</div>
4. <div align="justify">They are used at rough terrains where wheeled robots cannot be used.</div>

## Limitations
1. <div align="justify">Currently the robot has only 6 degree of freedom, so the motion has some constraints.</div>
2. <div align="justify">The bot is battery operated with small power supply, so regular change of battery is required.</div>
3. <div align="justify">Computer Vision or Ultrasonic sensing is not enabled, which means object detection cannot happen.</div>

## Future Improvements
1. <div align="justify">Size can be changed so as to human activities and task.</div>
2. <div align="justify">Degree of freedom can be increased to give proper flexibility in all directions and orientation.</div>
3. <div align="justify">Using Computer Vision for Obstacle detection, human recognition and corresponding Path planning.</div>
4. <div align="justify">Using IoT, this bot can be controlled from anywhere and can be live-streamed using webcam, it can be made autonomous using ML.</div>
